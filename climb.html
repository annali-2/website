                <h4>Climbing!!!! </h4>
                This page is dedicated to my love of climbing :) I actually tried it for the first time in high school, where we had a little wall in our gym. 
                I don't remember much, but I do remember learning the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_rope_climbing">top roping</a>. Basically, 
                that's when the climber is attached to a rope that is passed through an anchor at the top of the climb. As the climber continue upwards, the belayer, 
                the climber's partner, takes in the slack of the rope until the climber reaches the top. This gym unit didn't leave too much of an impression on me, 
                but it did teach me the basics that allowed my twin sister and I to climb at a gym called <a href="https://mesarim.com/missionvalley/">Mesa Rim</a> 
                in San Diego. We happened to notice the gym when we were eliminated from the tennis tournament we were competing at. We were in the area and had 
                like two hours to spare before our flight, so we decided to give it a shot! I just remember the gym being super tall with super colorful holds and 
                feeling so strong while scaling up the walls. Looking back, I realize that I probably looked like a noob (which I still am), but it set the level of 
                stoke I associated with climbing. After that, I don't think I climbed at all until moving to Seattle (August 2021). My roommate Lana was kind enough 
                to let me use one of her guest passes at <a href="https://seattleboulderingproject.com/" class="link-primary">Seattle Bouldering Project</a>, and I 
                ended up getting a membership. SBP only has indoor bouldering, but my girlfriend, who is a super strong climber and pictured on the right, 
                introduced me to outdoor bouldering, sport (indoor and outdoor), and trad climbing. I've been hooked since :D
